Project description:

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. Their bikes are geotracked and locked
into a network of stations across Chicago. Users can be either casual riders (with
single-ride or full-day passes) or annual members. The goal of this porject is to
identify key differences between casual riders and annual members. The results will
be a cornerstone for the design of a marketing strategy aiming to convert casual 
riders to annual members. 


Packages used:

Python was used for data preparation, processing and analysis.
Inkscape was used to prepare graphics.
Libre office impress was used for the final presentation.


Data used:

Cyclistic is a fictional company. The data used are from a real bike sharing company
(found here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and have been made
available by Motivate International Inc. under the license found here:
