# Bike traffic analysis

## Project description:

In this project, bike traffic is analyzed for two different user groups for a bike-sharing
company. The goal of the analysis is to identify key-differences between bike usage between 
the two groups.

## Scenario

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. Their bikes are geotracked and locked
into a network of stations across Chicago. Users can be either casual riders (with
single-ride or full-day passes) or annual members. The goal of this project is to
identify key differences between casual riders and annual members. Findings highlighted 
in the [final presentation](Presentation_CyclisticRidersAnalysis.pdf) will be a cornerstone for the design of a marketing strategy
aiming to convert casual riders to annual members.

## Data used:

Cyclistic is a fictional company. The data used are from a real bike sharing company
(found here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and have been made
available by Motivate International Inc. under the license found here: 
https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement. Data-privacy issues prohibit us from
using ridersâ€™ personally identifiable information (like any information related to credit
card numbers). We used data for rides between September 2020 and August 2021.

Analysis and findings were done in a jupyter notebook.

## Scenario details:

The scenario was the final capstone project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, 
a series of 8 courses by Google. It is based on a case study written by Kevin Hartman
(found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study).
