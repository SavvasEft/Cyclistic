Project description:

Cyclistic is a  bike sharing company operating in Chicago. Riders can be
either casual riders (paying for single-ride or daily pass) or members 
(paying annual membership). 

Financial analysis showed that members are much more profitable. The director
of marketing, Moreno, believes that maximizing members is key for the future
growth of the company. Her goal is to design marketing strategies to convert 
casual riders into annual members.

She assigned to me, a junior data analyst, to identify how annual members and
casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. The findings of this analysis
will be a cornerstone for the design of the marketing strategy.
